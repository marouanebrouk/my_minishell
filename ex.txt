âœ… Step 1: Detect if thereâ€™s a pipe
You already have a t_token *list. Letâ€™s write a simple helper:

c
Copy
Edit
int contains_pipe(t_token *list)
{
    while (list)
    {
        if (list->type == PIPE) // assuming PIPE is a defined enum/type
            return (1);
        list = list->next;
    }
    return (0);
}
You can now call this in ft_general_exec:

c
Copy
Edit
void ft_general_exec(t_token *list, char **envp)
{
    split_args_from_cmd(list);

    if (is_builtin(list->value))
        ft_handle_builtins(list, envp);
    else if (contains_pipe(list))
        ft_execute_pipeline(list, envp); // Youâ€™ll implement this next
    else
        ft_execute_cmd(list, envp);
}
âœ… Step 2: Prepare for ft_execute_pipeline
You want to:

Split the token list into subcommands using | as a separator.

Convert each subcommand into an array of arguments (char **args).

Collect them into a char ***commands.

Youâ€™ll want a function like:
c
Copy
Edit
char ***token_list_to_command_matrix(t_token *list, int *cmd_count);
Which:

Allocates memory

Creates one char **args per segment between pipes

Sets *cmd_count to the number of commands

âœ… Step 3: Example of token list to char ***
Imagine this token list:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"ls" NOT â†’ "|" PIPE â†’ "grep" NOT â†’ "a.out" NOT â†’ "|" PIPE â†’ "wc" NOT â†’ "-l" NOT
It should give:

c
Copy
Edit
commands[0] = {"ls", NULL};
commands[1] = {"grep", "a.out", NULL};
commands[2] = {"wc", "-l", NULL};
I can help you write this exact function (token_list_to_command_matrix) if you're ready for that next.

âœ… Final Integration Plan
Once you finish:

contains_pipe

token_list_to_command_matrix

Call execute_pipeline(commands, count);

Youâ€™ll have a fully working pipe system.

ðŸ”„ Shall we write token_list_to_command_matrix next?
Itâ€™s a bit of logic, but Iâ€™ll walk you through it step by step. Ready?
