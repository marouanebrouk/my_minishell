Method				Feasibility	Clean/Practical			Problems
Character-by-character parsing	Possible	✖️ Very messy	Hard to manage quotes, variables, and pipes
Split by space then process	Possible	✖️ Bug-prone	Doesn’t handle quotes or operators properly
Command-by-command parsing	Possible	✖️ Inefficient	Needs implicit tokenizing anyway
Proper tokenizer/lexer		✅ Recommended	✅ Cleanest	Easier, modular, and manageable





You technically can avoid calling it “tokenizing”, but you’ll end up doing it in some form no matter what.
 The cleanest, most reliable way is to explicitly tokenize first.
